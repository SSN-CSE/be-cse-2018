** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn and use network commands.
- To learn socket programming.
- To implement and analyze various network protocols.
- To learn and use simulation tools.
- To use simulation tools to analyze the performance of various network protocols.

** SUGGESTIVE LAB EXERCISES
1. Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine.
2. Write a HTTP web client program to download a web page using TCP
   sockets.
3. Write applications using TCP sockets like:
   - Echo client and echo server
   - Chat
   - File Transfer
4. Simulate of DNS using UDP sockets.
5. Write programs simulating ARP /RARP protocols.
6. Study of Network simulator (NS) and Simulation of Congestion
   Control Algorithms using NS.
7. Study of TCP/UDP performance using Simulation tool.
8. Simulate Distance Vector/ Link State Routing algorithm.
9. Evaluate the performance of Routing protocols using Simulation
   tool.
10. Simulate of error correction code (like CRC).
