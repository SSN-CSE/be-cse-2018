** Course Objectives
- Understand graphics programming in OpenGL using OpenGL and GLUT frameworks
- Implement algorithms for line and circle drawing
- Apply 2D, 3D transformations and clipping on objects
- Learn to draw 3D objects and apply projection techniques
- Explore image manipulation and enhancement techniques
- Create 3D animation using any tool

** List of Experiments
1. Study of Basic output primitives in OpenGL
2. Implementation of Algorithms for drawing 2D Primitives –
  a) Line (DDA, Bresenham) - all slopes   
  b) Circle (Midpoint)
3. 2D Geometric transformations –  Translation, Rotation, Scaling, Reflection and Shear
4. 2D Composite Transformations and Window to viewport mapping
5. Implementation of Line clipping algorithm
6. 3D Geometric Transformations - Translation, Rotation and Scaling
7. 3D Projections - Parallel and Perspective projection
8. Image Editing and Manipulation - 
   a) Basic Operations on image like applying masks, filters, adding/removing noise
   b) Creating gif animated images
9. Creation of a simple 2D animation
10. Creation of a simple 3D animation

\hfill *Total: <45 Periods>*

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Demonstrate drawing of basic output primitives (line and circle) using algorithms and hence draw complex shapes using them (K3)
- Illustrate basic, composite transformations and clipping on 2 dimensional objects (K2)
- Apply transformations and projections on 3 dimensional objects and construct any scene with features including lighting, textures, shadows, changing camera angles (K6)
- Illustrate basic operations on images, create GIF animated images and 2D animation sequence (K6)
- Create simple 3D animation (K6)
