** Course Objectives


- To use basic programming concepts of C 

- To develop programs using loops, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, structures and files



{{{unit}}}

|Unit I | BASICS  | 6 |

Algorithm -- structure of a C program -- data types: built-in, user-defined -- variables and
constants -- input and output statements -- operators, expressions, and assignment statements -- control statements.


{{{unit}}}

|Unit II | FUNCTIONS | 6 |

Function prototype -- function definition and call -- passing parameters -- built-in functions --
-- recursion; 

{{{unit}}}

|Unit III | ARRAYS AND POINTERS | 6 |

Arrays: declaration, initialization -- one dimensional arrays – multi-dimensional arrays; Pointers: pointer operators -- pointer operations -- array of pointers, -- passing arrays to functions

{{{unit}}}

|Unit IV | STRINGS, STRUCTURES AND UNIONS | 6 |

Strings: constants and variables, reading and writing strings, string operations, string library;
Command line arguments; Structures: nested structures -- structures and functions -- array of
structures -- pointer to a structure – unions ; Dynamic memory
allocation

{{{unit}}}

|Unit V | FILES  | 6 |

Files: opening and closing a data file -- creating a data file -- processing a data file --
unformatted data files -- formatted input and output -- line input and output – file error handling.

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
 -  Program using I/O statements, conditional constructs (if, switch, ternary)  and looping constructs (for, while, do-while) 

 - Program functions with different parameter passing techniques: Call by value (e.g. swapping two numbers), call by reference (e.g. changing the elements of an array), Recursion (e.g. binary search)

 - Program one dimensional arrays (e.g. inserting an element after every ith position in an array, Insertion sort)

 - Program using multi-dimensional arrays (e.g. matrix manipulations)

 - Program using strings and their operations (e.g. concatenation of strings, extracting a substring, checking for palindrome, search for a given string using binary search)

 - Program to demonstrate simple structure manipulations (e.g. generating a transcript with CGPA and class obtained)

 - Programs to demonstrate file operations (e.g. count the number of characters, words and lines in a file, replace a specific word with the given word in the same file)
