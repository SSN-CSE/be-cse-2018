** Course Objectives
- To capture the requirements specification for an intended software system
- To draw the UML diagrams for the given specification
- To map the design properly to code
- To test the software system thoroughly for all scenarios

** Suggestive List of Experiments

Draw standard UML diagrams using an UML modeling tool for a given case study and map design to code and implement a 3 layered architecture and generate test cases.
1. To develop a problem statement.
2. Document the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the identified system.
2. Identify Use Cases and develop the Use Case model.
3. Identify the conceptual classes and develop a domain model with UML Class diagram.
4. Using the identified scenarios, find the interaction between objects and represent them using UML Sequence and Collaboration diagrams.
5. Draw relevant state charts diagram. 
6. Draw the activity diagrams for the system.
7. Identify the User Interface, Domain objects, and Technical services. Draw the partial layered,
logical architecture diagram with UML package diagram notation.
8. Test the software system for all the scenarios identified as per the usecase diagram
