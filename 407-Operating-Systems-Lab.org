** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn and implement basic Unix commands using system calls
- To implement various CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- To implement Process Creation and Inter Process Communication
- To implement Deadlock Avoidance and Deadlock Detection algorithms
- To implement Page Replacement Algorithms
- To implement File Organization and File Allocation Strategies

#+begin_comment
 Shell programming experiment removed.
 Deadlock detection is removed as deadlock avoidance is already there under deadlock concept.
