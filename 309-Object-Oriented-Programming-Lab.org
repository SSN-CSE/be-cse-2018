** Course Objectives
- To build software development skills using object oriented
  programming for real world applications.
- To develop applications using inheritance and polymorphism.
- To understand and implement generic programming.

** List of experiments
1. Program using classes and objects (Ex: Electricity bill generation)
2. Program to perform string operations using ArrayList. 
3. Program to implement packages (Ex: Currency converter)
4. Program using Inheritance (Ex: Payroll application)
5. Prgram to implement Polymorphism (Ex. Area of different shapes)
6. Program to implement generic methods (Ex: Sorting)
7. Design a Java interface for ADTs. (Ex. Stack, Queue) 
8. Program to perform file operations. (Ex.existence, permission,type, length in bytes) 
9. Develop a mini project for any application using the constructs of Java. 


\hfill *Total: 45 Hours*
