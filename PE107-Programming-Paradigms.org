** Course Objectives
- To introduce various programming paradidgms
- To understand programming paradigms such as imperative, object-oriented, logic, functional and concuuent with illustrative    
  examples


|Unit I | Imperative and Object Oriented Programming  | 9 |
Role of programming languages, programming paradigms, Structured programming - Data representation, procedure activations, Examples in C

|Unit II | Object Oriented Programming | 9 |
Abstract data types, object model, object-oriented thinking, Examples in Java/Python/C++

|Unit III | Functional Programming  | 9 |
Elements of functional programming: values and operations,approaches to expression evaluation, lexical scope, type checking -  Haskell: Expressions, lists, types and values, control flow, functions, tuples, problem solving

|Unit IV | Logic Programming | 9 |
Logic and Horn clauses, Prolog: data structures, programming techniques, control, cuts, examples

|Unit V | Concurrent Programming       | 9 |
 Concurrency concepts – synchronization strategies – interleaving, liveness, safe access to shared data, examples in Ada / Java
 
Total: 45
