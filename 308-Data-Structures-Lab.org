** Course Objectives
- Understand and apply suitable data structure â€“ linear and non linear
- Design the data structure for the given problem and implement them in a high level programming language
- Understand the concepts and differences in searching and sorting techniques
- Learn the introductory concepts of hashing techniques


Lab Experiments
1.	Array implementation of list ADT
2.	Implement singly and doubly linked list ADTs
3.	Represent a polynomial as a linked list and write functions for polynomial addition
4.	Array implementation of Stack and Queue ADTs
5.	Linked list implementation of Stack and Queue ADTs
6.	Convert infix to postfix expression and evaluate using Stack ADT 
7.	Implement an expression tree. Produce its pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals
8.	Implement binary search tree
9.	Implement AVL trees
10.	Implement priority queue using binary heaps
11.	Graph representation and implement traversal algorithms
12.	Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using graph 
13.	Implement binary search, insertion sort and quick sort 
14.	Implement hashing using separate chaining technique

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Write functions to implement linear and non-linear data structure operations (K2)  
- Suggest and use appropriate linear / non-linear data structure operations for solving a given problem (K3)
- Gain practical experience in analyzing the real time problems or applications (K3)
- Apply appropriate hash functions that result in a collision free scenario for data storage and retrieval (K3)
