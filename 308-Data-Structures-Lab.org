** Course Objectives
- Understand and apply suitable data structure – linear and non linear
- Design the data structure for the given problem and implement them in a high level programming language
- Understand the concepts and differences in searching and sorting techniques
- Learn the introductory concepts of hashing techniques


{{{Lab Experiments}}}
1.	Array implementation of List ADT
2.	Implement singly and doubly linked list ADTs
3.	Represent a polynomial as a linked list and write functions for polynomial addition.
4.	Array implementation of Stack and Queue ADTs
5.	Linked list implementation of Stack and Queue ADTs
6.	Convert infix to postfix expression and evaluate using Stack ADT 
7.	Implement a double-ended queue (Deque) where insertion and deletion operations are possible at both the ends
8.	Implement an expression tree. Produce its pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals
9.	Implement binary search tree
10.	Implement AVL trees
11.	Implement priority queue using binary heaps
12.	Graph representation and implement traversal algorithms
13.	Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using graph 
14.	Implement Binary search, Insertion sort and Quick sort 
15.	Implement hashing with separate chaining

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Write functions to implement linear and non-linear data structure operations  
- Suggest and use appropriate linear / non-linear data structure operations for solving a given problem 
- Gain practical experience in analyzing the real time problems or applications (K3)
- Apply appropriate hash functions that result in a collision free scenario for data storage and retrieval (K3)
