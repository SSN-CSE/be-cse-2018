** Course Objectives
- Understand and apply suitable data structure â€“ linear and non linear
- Design the data structure for the given problem and implement them in a high level programming language
- Understand the concepts and differences in searching and sorting techniques
- Learn the introductory concepts of hashing techniques


Suggestive Lab Experiments
- Array implementation of list ADT (e.g Manage student records)
- Represent polynomial expression as linked list and write functions for polynomial manipulation
- Implement doubly linked list ADT (e.g Insert, delete, search, merge, reverse operations)
- Array implementation of Stack ADT (e.g Balancing paranthesis, infix to postfix conversion, evaluation of postfix expression)
- Array implementation of Queue ADT (e.g Simulating printer jobs)
- Implement an expression tree. Produce its pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals
- Implement binary search tree 
- Implement AVL trees (e.g Implement dictionary)  
- Implement priority queue using binary heaps (e.g Storing employee records based upon salary)
- Graph representation and implement graph traversal algorithms 
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using graph (e.g Find the shortest route to connect one city to another)
- Implement binary search and any two sorting algorithms 
- Implement hashing using separate chaining technique

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Implement linear and non-linear data structures to solve a given problem (K3)
- Analyze a problem statement and suggest an appropriate linear / non-linear data structure
  for solving it (K4)
- Implement sorting, seraching and hashing algorithms (K2)
